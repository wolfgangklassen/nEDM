# nEDM
program development for the nEDM experiment at TRIUMF

I am a masters student at the University of Manitoba, working on magnetometery for the nEDM experiment at TRIUMF.  My primary code work thus far is in extracting gradient values for a magnetic field, given field measurements provided by simulated magnetometers.  Eventually this will be used, along with a genetic algorithm, to fnd the optimal placement of magnetometers in a magnetically controlled volume in order to accurately extract gradient values.
